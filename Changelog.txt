To do:
* Install a global hook to reclip mouse upon focus change, and not each 1/2 sec
* Allow shortcut changes for the following functions:
  - Enable/disable mouse management
  - Restore settings
  - Teleport mouse to the next region
  - Teleport mouse to the previous region (also needs added support)
* In automatic mode - detect the actual touching boundaries of adjacent displays and not only boundaries of the current display, and fire tray icon notification only on touching boundaries.
* Create and destroy the preview forms instead of only hiding them.

v.1.1
* Preview rectangles were set as option, allowing to enable / disable them, with default disabled.
* Fully automatic mode was added and set as default:
  - The program reacts automatically to any display configuration/resolution changes.
  - Preview rectangles are updated accordingly, if preview enabled and program not minimized.
  - Coordinates are automatically recalculated for any change and can't be entered manually in automatic mode.
* "Mouse teleport" mechanism was added to teleport mouse between displays with a keyboard shortcut.
* Some optimizations were made in the code to reduce CPU load on mouse movement.
* Since the program has no taskbar icon, it can be "lost" when the focus is lost, so the window was made topmost when open, and its design was changed a bit to incorporate new options.
* Changed the tray icon menu to include "restore" option.
* Changed the tray icon left click behavior to restore on single click.
* Added exit hook, removing the global hooks and restoring control on forced exit


v.1.0b
* Base version released
